## Good to know @ PHP

- [PHP The Right Way](https://phptherightway.com/)  A full example of good documentation with higher standards about code quality

- [PHP The Wrong Way](https://phpthewrongway.com/) Is the other point of view of PHP The Right way, his focus create discussion and thought about current practices and extreme views.

- The [PHP Standard Recommendations (PSR)](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/) serve the standardization of programming concepts in PHP. The aim is to enable interoperability of components and to provide a common technical basis for implementation of proven concepts for **optimal programming and testing practices**. The PHP-FIG is formed by several PHP frameworks founders.

- Symfony enforces [Coding Standards](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html) "to make every piece of code look and feel familiar". The [PHP Coding Standards Fixer (PHP CS Fixer) tool](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) fixes your code to follow standards; whether you want to follow PHP coding standards as defined in the PSR-1, PSR-2, etc., or other community driven ones like the Symfony one. You can also define your (team's) style through configuration.

- [PHPUnit - Chapter 10. Testing Practices](https://phpunit.de/manual/6.5/en/testing-practices.html) mentions the **4 rules of simple design**…

    > The following conditions will help you to improve the code and design of your project, while using unit tests to verify that the refactoring's transformation steps are, indeed, behavior-preserving and do not introduce errors:
    >
    > - All unit tests run correctly.
    > - The code communicates its design principles.
    > - The code contains no redundancies.
    > - The code contains the minimal number of classes and methods.

    … and suggests **Test-Driven Development**:

    > When you need to add new functionality to the system, write the tests first. Then, you will be done developing when the test runs. This practice will be discussed in detail in the next chapter.

- [The talking big](https://franiglesias.github.io/) is a blog in **Spanish** of Fran Iglesias about PHP with a lot of interesting topics like [an introduction to Domain Driven Design](https://franiglesias.github.io/ddd-intro/) or [Solid](https://franiglesias.github.io/principios-solid/). He is also the writer of two books focused on PHP ["La guía del refactor cotidiano"](https://leanpub.com/refactorcotidiano) and ["Testing y TDD para PHP"](https://leanpub.com/testingytddparaphp)
