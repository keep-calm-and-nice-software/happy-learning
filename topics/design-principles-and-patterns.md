# Design principles & patterns

## Books

* The "original book" [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/design-patterns-elements/0201633612/) Written by The Gang of Four are the four authors of the book (John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson, Richard Helm, Erich Gamma

* [Head First Design Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126.do) a book to try to explain and understand patterns with a lot of examples.

## Articles

* [Tell don't ask](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TellDontAsk.html): An article of [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/) explanation the principles of the "Tell-Don't-Ask"

> It reminds us that rather than asking an object for data and acting on that data, we should instead tell an object what to do. This encourages to move behavior into an object to go with the data.

* [Composition vs inheritance how choose](https://www.thoughtworks.com/es/insights/blog/composition-vs-inheritance-how-choose)

> In the Beginning...there was no inheritance and no composition, only code. And the code was **unwieldy, repetitive, blocky, unhappy, verbose, and tired**.

> As a heuristic, **"favor composition over inheritance"** is okay, however, I am not a fan of mantras. While they often contain a kernel of truth, it is far too easy for people to hear the slogan without understanding its source or context, and thus avoid thinking for themselves - and that never turns out well.

> Composition is fairly easy to understand - we can see composition in everyday life: a chair has legs, a wall is composed of bricks and mortar, and so on.

> Inheritance captures semantics (meaning) in a classification hierarchy (a taxonomy), arranging concepts from generalized to specialized, grouping related concepts in subtrees, and so on 

* In [S.O.L.I.D: The First 5 Principles of Object Oriented Design](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design) we read a introduction to SOLID principles in PHP by [Samuel Oloruntoba](https://twitter.com/KayandraJT)

> Honestly, S.O.L.I.D might seem to be a handful at first, but with continuous usage and adherence to its guidelines, it becomes a part of you and your code which can easily be extended, modified, tested, and refactored without any problems.
