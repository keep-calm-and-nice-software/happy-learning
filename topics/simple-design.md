## 4 rules of simple design

From [BeckDesignRules](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html), by Martin Fowler:

> The most important of the rules is "passes the tests". XP was revolutionary in how it raised testing to a first-class activity in software development, so it's natural that testing should play a prominent role in these rules. The point is that whatever else you do with the software, the primary aim is that it works as intended and tests are there to ensure that happens.

> "Reveals intention" is Kent's way of saying the code should be easy to understand. Communication is a core value of Extreme Programing, and many programmers like to stress that programs are there to be read by people. Kent's form of expressing this rule implies that the key to enabling understanding is to express your intention in the code, so that your readers can understand what your purpose was when writing it.

> The "no duplication" is perhaps the most powerfully subtle of these rules. It's a notion expressed elsewhere as DRY or SPOT, Kent expressed it as saying everything should be said "Once and only Once." Many programmers have observed that the exercise of eliminating duplication is a powerful way to drive out good designs.

> The last rule tells us that anything that doesn't serve the three prior rules should be removed. At the time these rules were formulated there was a lot of design advice around adding elements to an architecture in order to increase flexibility for future requirements. Ironically the extra complexity of all of these elements usually made the system harder to modify and thus less flexible in practice.

From [Essential XP: Emergent Design](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/classics/expemergentdesign/), by Ron Jeffries:

> There are many well-known modeling and design techniques that can be used to bring about a "good design". An incremental process may limit the applicability of these techniques, which are most powerful when applied and committed to "up front". Test everything; eliminate duplication; express all ideas; minimize entities:These few simple rules, applied locally, can help a high quality global design to emerge.

From [The Four Elements of Simple Design](https://blog.jbrains.ca/permalink/the-four-elements-of-simple-design), by J.B. Rainsberger:

> I have reduced everything I've ever learned about modular design to the four elements of simple design that I first learned from Kent Beck’s work. Maybe you can, too.


From [Putting An Age-Old Battle To Rest](https://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/putting-an-age-old-battle-to-rest), by J.B. Rainsberger:

> I have been teaching for years about how to reduce the four elements of simple design to two: after several months, I don’t think about writing tests any more—I simply call that “programming”—and I’ve never seen a well-factored code base that had an order of magniture too many elements. With these two points out of the way, I guide my design with two basic rules: remove duplication and improve names. I’ve started thinking about these guidelines a little differently.
