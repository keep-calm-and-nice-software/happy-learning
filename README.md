# happy-reading

Hi, I'm the living repository provided as part of the companion material to the technical training series “Keep Calm & Nice Software”, so far facilitated at:

- [Grupo Isastur](https://www.isastur.com) @ Asturias, Spain (December 2019)
- Your team, company or local community @ somewhere? (from March / April 2020 onwards)

## Overview

This repository contains companion material to the workshop series, including bibliography & additional resources.

Feel free to explore the Markdown files at your own risk :)

## The sessions

- #1 focuses on `simple-design.md`.
- #2 focuses on `design-principles-and-patterns.md`.
- #3 focuses on `refactoring.md`.

## Want to contribute?

Nice! Feel free to add an issue or to directly submit a PR, we'll be happy to review it :)

## Only in English?

- Material-wise? Yes. 
- Facilitation-wise? We are able (and happy) to run the training sessions in English, Spanish, German and Italian :) 

## What else?

Happy learning!
